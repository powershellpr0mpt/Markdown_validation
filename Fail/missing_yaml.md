# Naming Convention for Policies

## Default Device Configuration policies

These policies are generic and can directly be applied to a tenant without change.  
In certain cases where the default policy is changed to suit the customers needs, this should be reflected in the policy name.  
These policies include the 'new' Endpoint Security policies.

`<0xx>-v<Version>.<CustomerVersion>-<OS>-<Description>`

for example

* 001-v1-Win10-Device Restrictions
* 002-v3-MacOS-Device Restrictions
* 003-v1-iOS-Device Restrictions
* 004-v1.1-Android-Device Restrictions
* 005-v4-Win10-Endpoint Protection
